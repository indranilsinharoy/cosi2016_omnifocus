# Omnifocus Image Synthesis using Lens Swivel

Repository for sharing code, results and IPython computational notebooks from my research
related to the Imaging and Applied Optics (Imaging) Congress 2016 conference paper 
tilted "Omnifocus Image Synthesis using Lens Swivel"


**PLEASE NOTE:** The computational notebooks has not been "cleaned up" in its current form. 
It contains some of the experimentations and explorations. 
I expect to cleanup the notebook soon.
