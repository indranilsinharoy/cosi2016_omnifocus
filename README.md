# Omnifocus Image Synthesis using Lens Swivel

Repository for sharing code, results and IPython computational notebooks from my research
related to the Imaging and Applied Optics (Imaging) Congress 2016 conference paper 
tilted "Omnifocus Image Synthesis using Lens Swivel"


PLEASE NOTE: The computational notebook is not "clean" in its current form. It still contains 
some of the experimentations. I expect to cleanup the notebook soon.
